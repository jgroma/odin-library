# odin-library

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).
<br> 
<br>
The aim of this assignment is to create a small Library app that allows the user to add and remove books, and change their read status.  
<br>
Please note that "The Hobbit" book that you can see at the start is dummy content intended to showcase the design. This "book" is not an object nor a part of the myLibrary array. Therefore, it dissapears once you add your first book.
